### 1. Data model

Check file

### 2. Main user actions

The main actions the user would perform would be to add parts to the cart and then checkout.

### 3. Product page

I would present this as a multi-step process. For example, a user could choose in order:

1. Frame type
2. Frame paint
3. Wheels
4. Rim color
5. Chain

Along each step, the options presented will be the ones that are available combinations given the prervious choices. Steps should be skippable as well, given that a user doesn't want a specific part of the bike.

The price could be updated on the side as the user selects parts.

### 4. Add to cart action

Once the user adds to cart, we create a cart with all the parts selected.

### 5. Administrative workflows:

New product creation:
We will provide an admin panel for the admin to create a product, along with its variants, prices and stock.

Adding a new part choice:
Marcus will have to add a productVariant by selecting the product it belongs to. He will also need to specify the price
